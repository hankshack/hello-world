# hello-world

A shout out to y'all: 
expecially to you newbies and general fledgings like myself who have chosen this as a jumping off point into the GitHub waters etc. Just so you know, my goal/intention/plan is to immerse myself in the GitHub waters as I have with HTML/JS/CSS etc to continue my progression towards making myself competent and able to do what it takes as a freelance software developer.
